# Masquerading-files

Running Instructions: 
1) download the python file
2) open python file 
3) find a variable nammed **path** its at the end of the file
4) put the directory path in that variable in double quotes 
  for example:
          path = "New folder"
5) Then save the file and run this file 
6) file will scan through all subdirectories and files
7) the result will be generated as csv/excel file in the same directory where python file is running

To avoid providing the whole path to the path variable keep the python file in the same directory which you want to scan and just provide the name of directory in path variable.
